# a-simple-cracker-chase-game

I have Done a Small game in Python and because Writing games is a great fun . Unlike “proper” programs , games are not always tied to a formal specification and don’t need to do anything useful . They just must be fun to play . Games are a great place to experiment with your software to check whether it works or not Its pretty much like a self evaluation Process by ourself . You can write code just to see what happens when it runs , and see whether the result is interesting .



I'm Saying  :

Dont worry about whether yOur GAME IS complex or simple 
When you write a game, you control the universe
Using “artificial intelligence” makes games much more interesting
When you write a game, you can always cheat
Don’t worry about making the graphics hardware work for you
Make sure you tell people how to play your game
Adding a high score makes a game much more interesting
Always make a playable game
